	abstract = {Ports and their affiliated shipping routes are fundamental to the maritime logistics system, crucial for global trade. However, they face risks from natural disasters and human-induced crises. Enhancing port resilience, the ability to quickly recover and maintain operations during disruptions is vital for a robust maritime network. This study focuses on enhancing port resilience by improving the shipping route network, using an innovative link-prediction-based approach. Initially, a multi-dimensional resilience analysis is conducted to identify key low-resilience and bottleneck ports, guiding targeted network optimizations. Then, a novel link prediction algorithm is applied to find potential new shipping connections, significantly enhancing network efficiency, robustness, and port resilience. The optimized network effectively improves the connectivity of critical lowresilience ports with central hub ports and bottleneck ports with surrounding ones. Route diversification mitigates risks and strengthens overall resilience. Key low-resilience ports and bottleneck ports are reduced by an average of 20\% and 25\%. Finally, practical strategies are proposed. Low-resilience ports should establish direct connections with major hubs, and regional sub-networks can offer support. For bottleneck ports, additional secondary and short distance links should be added to transform them into more integrated hubs, enhancing the network’s robustness. These strategies improve the network’s operational capacity during crises, ensuring efficient cargo flow.},

This method imputes appropriate values for missing data based on similar ratings in each cluster. This has the advantages of more accurate process results in each cluster due to users’ similarity of interests, and the reduction of sparsity negative effect. This approach is represented on 3dimensional data of users, items and times.

	abstract = {The COVID-19 pandemic has stifled international trade and the global maritime industry. Its impact on the routing of the regional vessel traffic flow provides supportive data to port authorities, ship owners, shippers, and consignees. This study proposes a spatiotemporal dynamic graph neural network (STDGNN) model that includes the usual primary part of the vessel flow and an auxiliary part of newly confirmed COVID-19 cases near the port. The primary part consists of a time-embedding (TE) block, two dynamic graph neural network (DGNN) blocks, and a gated recurrent unit block, to capture the spatiotemporal dependence in the regional vessel traffic flow. The auxiliary part is made of multiple blocks to exploit the dynamic temporal relationships in hours, days, and weeks. Moreover, the performance of the STDGNN model is verified by utilising real vessel traffic flow data (i.e. inflow, outflow, and volume) and the new cases of COVID-19 near the port of New York, USA, provided by the automatic identification system and the Johns Hopkins University Centre for Systems Science and Engineering. The 2-h prediction result shows a 37.7\%, 17.23\%, and 11.4\% improvement in the mean absolute error (MAE) over the gated recurrent unit (GRU), STGCN, and TGCN models, respectively. The delicate and adaptable prediction of vessel traffic flow could help the port relieve congestion, enhance efficiency, and further assist the recovery of regional maritime industries in the post-COVID era.},

	abstract = {The intelligent maritime transportation system has emerged as a pivotal component in port management, owing to the rapid advancements in artiﬁcial intelligence and big data technology. Its essence lies in the application of digital modeling techniques, which leverage extensive ship data to facilitate efﬁcient operations. In this regard, effective modeling and accurate prediction of the ﬂuctuation patterns of ship trafﬁc in multiple port regions will provide data support for trade analysis, port construction planning, and trafﬁc safety management. In order to better express the potential interdependencies between ports, inspired by graph neural networks, this paper proposes a data-driven approach to construct a multi-port network and designs a spatiotemporal graph neural network model. The model incorporates graph attention networks and a dilated causal convolutional architecture to capture the temporal and spatial dimensions of trafﬁc variation patterns. It also employs a gated-mechanism-based spatiotemporal bi-dimensional feature fusion strategy to handle the potential unequal relationships between the two dimensions of features. Compared to existing methods for port trafﬁc prediction, this model fully considers the network characteristics of the overall port and ﬁlls the research gap in multi-port scenarios. In the experiments, real port ship trafﬁc datasets were constructed using data from the Automatic Identiﬁcation System (AIS) and port geographical information data for model validation. The results demonstrate that the model exhibits outstanding robustness and performs well in predicting trafﬁc in multiple sub-regional port clusters.},

This study proposes a comprehensive method for maritime traffic network construction and vessel flow prediction in the complex waterway systems of inland port clusters. First, an attention-enhanced Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (Bi-LSTM) network is employed to restore incomplete AIS trajectory data, ensuring the integrity of vessel movement records. Subsequently, a modified MD-DBSCAN clustering algorithm is introduced, which dynamically adjusts the ε and MinPts parameters based on local density variations to robustly extract traffic network structures. Building on this, a hybrid prediction model combining Graph Attention Networks (GAT) and Temporal Convolutional Networks (TCN), termed GAT-TCN, is developed to capture topological dependencies and temporal traffic dynamics across network nodes. Empirical validation using AIS data from the Pearl River Estuary results in the construction of a 60-node traffic network, with the proposed model achieving MAE, RMSE, PPTS and R2 values of 1.87, 2.52, 1.78 and 0.77, respectively. The GATTCN model outperforms baseline methods in capturing dynamic spatiotemporal vessel flow and improving prediction robustness in inland waterways.},

	abstract = {The accurate and robust prediction of vessel trafﬁc ﬂow is gaining importance in maritime intelligent transportation system (ITS), such as vessel trafﬁc services, maritime spatial planning, and trafﬁc safety management, etc. To achieve ﬁne-grained vessel trafﬁc ﬂow prediction, we will ﬁrst generate the maritime trafﬁc network (which is essentially a graph), and then propose a graph-driven neural network. In particular, to represent various correlations among spatio-temporal vessel trafﬁc ﬂow, we tend to extract the feature points (i.e., starting, way and ending points) by utilizing the knowledge of vessel positioning data. These feature points are essentially related to the geometrical structures of massive vessel trajectories collected from massive automatic identiﬁcation system (AIS) records, contributing to the generation of maritime trafﬁc network. We then propose a spatio-temporal multi-graph convolutional network (STMGCN)based vessel trafﬁc ﬂow prediction method by exploiting multiple types of inherent correlations in the generated maritime graph. The proposed STMGCN mainly contains one spatial multi-graph convolutional layer and two temporal gated convolutional layers, beneﬁcial for extracting spatial and temporal trafﬁc ﬂow patterns. The main beneﬁt of our graph-driven prediction method is that it takes full advantage of the maritime graph and multi-graph learning. Comprehensive experiments have been implemented on realistic AIS dataset to compare our method with several stateof-the-art prediction methods. The ﬁne-grained prediction results have demonstrated our superior performance in terms of both accuracy and robustness.},

Maritime transport research can be roughly divided into two categories, namely the shipping side and the port side. Most of the classic approaches adopted to address practical problems in these research topics are based on long-term observations and expert knowledge, while few of them are based on historical data accumulated from practice. In recent years, emerging approaches, which we refer to as machine learning and deep learning techniques in this essay, have been receiving a wider attention to solve practical problems. As a relatively conservative industry, there are some initial trials of applying the emerging approaches to solve practical problems in the maritime sector. The objective of this essay is to review the application of emerging approaches to maritime transport research. The main research topics in maritime transport and classic methods developed to solve them are first presented. The introduction of emerging approaches and their suitability to be applied in maritime transport research is then discussed. Related existing studies are then reviewed according to problem settings, main data sources, and emerging approaches adopted. Challenges and solutions in the process are also discussed from the perspectives of data, model, users, and targets. Finally, promising future research directions are identified. This essay is the first to give a comprehensive review of existing studies on developing machine learning and deep learning models together with popular data sources used to address practical problems in maritime transport.},

This paper introduces a multisource data fusion approach with graph convolutional neural networks (GCNs) for node‐level traffic flow prediction. Specifically, it extracts different types of traffic flows from multiple data sources and constructs a unified graph structure by using global traffic nodes to interpolate the traffic flow. In addition, a GCN combined with gated recurrent units (GRUs) is proposed for spatiotemporal modeling of data fusion and traffic flow prediction. The main contributions are: (1) The approach significantly improved prediction accuracy by leveraging multiple data sources compared to a single source. (2) A unified graph structure was created via global traffic nodes to interpolate traffic flow and address data sparsity. (3) The proposed model demonstrates an over 11\% improvement in accuracy compared to other baseline models, as measured by the weighted mean absolute percentage error (WMAPE). It also exhibits stability in multitime scale predictions, highlighting the effectiveness of multisource data fusion, data imputation, and node‐level prediction capabilities. The approach provides valuable insights for managing urban traffic data from multiple sources and predicting traffic flow, and it shows stability in multitime scale predictions.},

Recent city-level traffic flow forecasting works rely on accurate prior knowledge of graphs (i.e., the spatial relationships between roads), which hinders their effectiveness and application in the real world. We propose a novel framework for urban traffic flow forecasting, which simultaneously infers and utilizes the relationship between time series. In our model, the graph structure learning module dynamically captures the correlation and causation between the different time series and infers a potentially fully connected graph. At the same time, the temporal convolution network captures the temporal correlation between a single time series. The graph neural network uses the graph for forecasting. Our model no longer relies on accurate graph priors and achieves better forecasting results than previous work. Experiments on two public datasets verify that the proposed model is very competitive.},

To address this issue, we propose a novel metro traffic flow prediction method (KGR-STGNN) based on knowledge graph representation learning. We construct a knowledge graph that stores factors related to metro traffic networks. Through the knowledge graph representation learning technology, we can learn the influence representation of external factors from the traffic knowledge graph, which can better incorporate the influence of external factors into the prediction model based on the spatiotemporal graph neural network.

	abstract = {Learning to store information over extended time intervals by recurrent backpropagation takes a very long time, mostly because of insufficient, decaying error backflow. We briefly review Hochreiter's (1991) analysis of this problem, then address it by introducing a novel, efficient, gradient based method called long short-term memory (LSTM). Truncating the gradient where this does not do harm, LSTM can learn to bridge minimal time lags in excess of 1000 discrete-time steps by enforcing constant error flow through constant error carousels within special units. Multiplicative gate units learn to open and close access to the constant error flow. LSTM is local in space and time; its computational complexity per time step and weight is O. 1. Our experiments with artificial data involve local, distributed, real-valued, and noisy pattern representations. In comparisons with real-time recurrent learning, back propagation through time, recurrent cascade correlation, Elman nets, and neural sequence chunking, LSTM leads to many more successful runs, and learns much faster. LSTM also solves complex, artificial long-time-lag tasks that have never been solved by previous recurrent network algorithms.},

	abstract = {We use the k-core decomposition to visualize large scale complex networks in two dimensions. This decomposition, based on a recursive pruning of the least connected vertices, allows to disentangle the hierarchical structure of networks by progressively focusing on their central cores. By using this strategy we develop a general visualization algorithm that can be used to compare the structural properties of various networks and highlight their hierarchical structure. The low computational complexity of the algorithm, O(n+e), where 'n' is the size of the network, and 'e' is the number of edges, makes it suitable for the visualization of very large sparse networks. We apply the proposed visualization tool to several real and synthetic graphs, showing its utility in finding specific structural fingerprints of computer generated and real world networks.},
